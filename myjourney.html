            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey with animals began at a very young age. 
                At as young as 3 years old, I was already showing a deep love and compassion for animals. I come from a medium-sized family 
                with 6 siblings, and we always had pets growing up. Much of the time I only had either cats, rabbits, or fish as a child.
                My 5 brothers always had the big dogs that were often escape artists. Even though that was the case I wanted my own dog.
                For my 15th birthday, one of my friends took me to pick up a pure bred Border Collie whose name is Twinkle. She is the smartest 
                dog, I've so far had. Although she is very smart, unfortanately she was abused by her previous owner. She has some very deep seated
                fear of people who aren't myself or my mother. When I brought her home she instantly bonded with the 2 of us. I sadly wasn't able to
                get her over her fear of other people, but I was able to get her to trust me and my mom. Fortunately I was able to train her to do
                basic commands. But over the years she has been my best friend and has helped me through some very tough times.
                I have always had a passion for helping animals and I knew that I wanted to work with them in some capacity.
